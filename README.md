# javafx-old-but-gold
The shitty-simple-applications I made with JavaFX to prepare me for the java exam at unitn

## Exercises:

* ToggleTastierino
* TastoMancante

These projects are exercises commited by the professor and are made only with JavaFX. The only thing I used that in the exam would not have been possible was the material library [jfoenix](http://www.jfoenix.com).

## Exams without FXML:

* CarGame
* DiceGame
* WorldCup

These are old exams solved only by using JavaFX and nothing else. The solutions may be partial and not perfect because I used them only to prepare me for the exam and I did not want to loose too much time.

## Exams with FXML:

* CarPeople
* HanoiTower
* TesseratGame

These are old exams too, but I solved them by using FXML for the layout. It was not an argument treated by the professor but it is very easy to learn if you already used XML with AndroidStudio or HTML with websites and it saves you a huge amount of time. 

## Releases:

In the [release](https://github.com/euberdeveloper/javafx-old-but-gold/releases) section, you can find all the zipped projects ready to be downloaded
